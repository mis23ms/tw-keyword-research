⚡ Engineering Insight
The burgeoning demand for AI and High-Performance Computing (HPC) has unveiled a critical bottleneck in the semiconductor supply chain: advanced packaging capacity. While TSMC leads with its CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) technology, a 2.5D integration solution essential for integrating high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with logic dies, its current expansion efforts are struggling to keep pace with the exponential growth in AI accelerator orders.

As of February 2, 2026, the global artificial intelligence landscape remains in the grip of an "AI super-cycle," where the ability to deploy large-scale models is limited not by software ingenuity, but by the physical architecture of silicon. At the center of this storm is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM), whose advanced packaging technology, Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), has become the single most critical bottleneck in the production of next-generation AI accelerators.
