    "summary": "As of February 2, 2026, the global artificial intelligence landscape remains in the grip of an \"AI super-cycle,\" where the ability to deploy large-scale models is limited not by software ingenuity, but by the physical architecture of silicon. At the center of this storm is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE: TSM), whose advanced packaging technology, Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), has become the single most critical bottleneck in the production of next-generation AI accelerators."
