    "summary": "Of the countless technologies invented over the past half century, high-temperature superconductors are among the most promising and yet also the most frustrating. Decades of research has yielded an assortment of materials that superconduct at temperatures as high as -140 °C (133 kelvins) at ambient pressure. And yet commercial applications have been elusive.\nNow, though, a couple of developments could finally push high-temperature superconductors into commercial use."
